# Shell Cryptocurrency: Technical Architecture

## Overview

Shell is a supply chain-oriented cryptocurrency designed to dramatically reduce Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) and accounts receivables between importers and exporters. The platform enables automated payments based on smart contracts configured in the HandReceipt supply chain management system. Shell payments are triggered automatically when an importer's HandReceipt system scans an item upon receipt, which updates the status of the incoming item on the HandReceipt blockchain (visible to both counterparties).

## 1. Core Blockchain Architecture

### Consensus Protocol: Delegated Proof of Supply Chain (DPoSC)
- **Validator Selection**: 21-30 validators elected by token holders, with special weight given to active supply chain participants
- **Block Production**: Round-robin block production among validators (3-5 second block times)
- **Finality Mechanism**: PBFT-inspired finality where 2/3 of validators must confirm each block
- **Validator Requirements**: Validators must stake Shell tokens and maintain reliable infrastructure

### Network Topology
- **Node Types**:
  - **Validator Nodes**: Run by elected validators, participate in consensus
  - **Full Nodes**: Maintain complete blockchain history, operated by major stakeholders
  - **Light Nodes**: For regular users and smaller businesses, sync only headers and relevant transactions
  - **API Nodes**: Public-facing nodes providing API access to the network

### Block Structure
- **Header**: 
  - Block height, timestamp, previous block hash
  - Merkle root of transactions
  - Validator signature
- **Body**:
  - Transaction data
