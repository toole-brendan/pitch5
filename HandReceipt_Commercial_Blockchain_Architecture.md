# HandReceipt Commercial Blockchain Architecture

This document outlines the ideal blockchain architecture for the commercial version of HandReceipt, focusing specifically on supply chain and warehouse management.

## Core Blockchain Architecture

### Hybrid Public-Private Structure

#### Layer 1: Public Settlement Layer
- A public blockchain component for transaction finality, transparency, and interoperability
- Provides immutable verification of critical supply chain events
- Enables Shell token transactions and settlement
- Maintains a global state of ownership and record of transfers
- Implements sharding for scalability while maintaining security

#### Layer 2: Private Sidechains
- Company-specific or supply-chain-partner-specific private sidechains
- Protects sensitive inventory data (pricing, quantities, supplier relationships)
- Higher transaction throughput for frequent inventory updates
- Lower transaction costs for operational activities
- Allows custom permission settings for different network participants

#### Bridging Protocol
- Secure bridges between public and private layers
- Cryptographic proof generation for private chain events without revealing sensitive data
- Zero-knowledge proofs to validate private chain transactions on the public layer
- State channels for frequent updates between trusted parties

### Consensus Mechanism

#### Public Layer: Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
- Energy-efficient alternative to Proof of Work
- Allows Shell token holders to vote for block validators
- Higher throughput than traditional PoW
- Governance role for industry stakeholders

#### Private Sidechains: Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)
- Optimized for known participants
- High transaction throughput
- Low latency for real-time inventory updates
- Finality without lengthy confirmation times

## Digital Twin Implementation

### Inventory Representation

#### Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) for Unique Items
- Each significant inventory item represented as a unique NFT
- Contains complete history, provenance, and specifications
- Metadatabase for extended properties (dimensions, materials, certifications)
- QR code linkage to physical items

#### Semi-Fungible Tokens for Batch Processing
- For identical items that can be grouped (e.g., bulk commodities)
- Allows partial transfers while maintaining batch integrity
- Supports subdivision without losing provenance information

### State Transitions
- Smart contract-driven state changes for inventory lifecycle
- Predefined valid state transitions (e.g., manufactured → warehoused → in-transit → delivered)
- Events emitted for all state changes, triggering notifications in the application

### Multi-signature Requirements
- Transfer transactions require signatures from both sender and receiver
- Option for third-party validation signatures (quality inspector, customs agent, etc.)
- Threshold signatures for high-value items requiring multiple approvals

## Smart Contract Infrastructure

### Contract Types

#### Transfer Contracts
- Handle movement of inventory between parties
- Enforce required validations and approvals
- Support conditional releases based on predefined criteria
- Escrow functionality for disputed transfers

#### Payment Automation Contracts
- Link inventory receipt to automatic payment
- Support both Shell token and USDC stablecoin payments
- Include installment and conditional payment schedules
- Dynamic pricing based on delivery time, quality metrics, etc.

#### Supply Agreement Contracts
- Codify supplier-buyer relationships with terms and conditions
- Auto-generate transfer and payment contracts based on master agreement
- Include SLA parameters with performance monitoring
- Support for rebates, penalties, and volume discounts

#### Compliance and Certification Contracts
- Verify regulatory compliance for sensitive goods
- Track certifications and expirations
- Document chain of custody for regulated industries
- Audit trails for environmental and ethical standards

### Oracle Integration

#### External Data Feeds
- Real-time pricing information for commodities
- Exchange rates for international trade
- Weather conditions affecting shipping
- Regulatory updates affecting compliance requirements

#### IoT Sensor Integration
- Temperature and humidity monitoring for sensitive goods
- Location tracking for in-transit inventory
- Shock detection for fragile items
- Authentication verification through physical markers (RFID, NFC)

## Shell Token Integration

### Token Economics

#### Utility Functions
- Transaction fees for blockchain operations
- Staking for private sidechain participation
- Governance voting rights proportional to stake
- Discount mechanism for platform services

#### Supply Chain Incentives
- Rewards for validating transfers and maintaining chain integrity
- Staking requirements for network participants based on transaction volume
- Liquidity pools for instant settlement between supply chain partners
- Rebate programs for high-volume users

#### Integration with External Financial Systems
- Bridges to traditional banking for fiat on/off ramps
- Conversion services between Shell tokens and other cryptocurrencies
- Wrapped token support for cross-chain compatibility
- Compliance with relevant financial regulations

### Tokenized Financing

#### Inventory-backed Lending
- Use verified on-chain inventory as collateral
- Smart contracts for automatic loan servicing
- Dynamic loan-to-value ratios based on inventory characteristics
- Liquidation procedures for default scenarios

#### Receivables Financing
- Tokenization of accounts receivable for faster liquidity
- Secondary market for trading receivables tokens
- Automated factoring with risk-based pricing
- Improved financing terms based on on-chain payment history

## Security and Privacy Framework

### Data Protection

#### Partitioned Data Storage
- Sensitive business data remains off-chain
- Cryptographic references link on-chain records to off-chain details
- Selective disclosure mechanisms for partners
- Homomorphic encryption for computing on encrypted data

#### Role-based Access Control
- Granular permissions based on organizational role
- Time-limited access grants for specific operations
- Delegated authority with approval chains
- Audit logging for all access attempts

#### Privacy-preserving Analytics
- Differential privacy techniques for aggregate insights
- Secure multi-party computation for cross-organization analysis
- Anonymous benchmarking against industry standards
- Confidential reporting for regulatory requirements

### Network Security

#### Threat Monitoring
- Real-time detection of abnormal transaction patterns
- Protection against double-spend and replay attacks
- Distributed denial of service (DDoS) mitigation
- Validator node security requirements and audits

#### Key Management
- Hierarchical deterministic wallets for organizational use
- Multi-signature requirements for administrative functions
- Key rotation policies and procedures
- Hardware security module integration for critical operations
