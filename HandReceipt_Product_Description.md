# HandReceipt Product Description

## HandReceipt: Modernizing Supply Chain Management

HandReceipt is a blockchain-powered inventory and supply chain management solution that streamlines property tracking and transfers.

## Military Application

HandReceipt digitizes the currently paper-based process of equipment transfers between military personnel. Using scannable QR codes linked to blockchain-secured digital records, we make property accountability simple, reliable, and auditable. Seeks to implement best practices and advantages enabled by private sector systems like SAP, NetSuite, Oracle, and Microsoft Dynamics.

## Commercial Application

For businesses, HandReceipt offers a more affordable and user-friendly alternative to complex enterprise systems like SAP, NetSuite, Oracle, and Microsoft Dynamics. Our solution maintains accurate inventory records while enabling rapid payment processing through USDC stablecoin integrationâ€”allowing for immediate settlement when goods are received and verified.

### Integration Features
- Commercial users can integrate with existing systems rather than requiring entirely new hardware or processes, including integrating standard enterprise software APIs (ERP, WMS, inventory management)
- Commercial users can employ existing scanning infrastructure (barcodes, RFID) rather than QR codes
- Commercial users have ability to create smart contracts outlining payment terms between counterparties in supply chain 
  - Use of either traditional wire or HandReceipt's own native coin called "Shells" (SHL)
  - Smart contracts completely customizable (can trigger payments based on receipt of goods, sales levels, inventory levels, etc)

## Key Benefits

- Secure digital property records that can't be altered
- Simple QR-code scanning for transfers and verification
  - User uses mobile app to scan a QR code on property or inventory to initiate a transfer request
  - Counterparty who currently in possession of (or is assigned) that piece of property receives notification of transfer request which they can either accept or decline
- Reduced paperwork and manual processes
- Transparent tracking throughout the supply chain
- Optional fast payment settlement for commercial users

## How It Works

### Military Use Case
1. A military logistics officer assigns equipment to a unit
2. The unit's representative scans the QR code using the HandReceipt mobile app
3. All details including equipment condition, serial numbers, and maintenance history are visible
4. The transfer is recorded on the blockchain, creating an immutable audit trail
5. When equipment is transferred again, the same process ensures continuous accountability

### Commercial Use Case
1. Supplier ships goods with HandReceipt-generated QR codes
2. Receiver scans codes upon delivery
3. System verifies quantity and condition
4. Smart contract automatically triggers payment
5. Real-time update of inventory levels
6. Complete chain of custody maintained on blockchain
