# HandReceipt & Shell Token

This repository contains the pitch deck and application for HandReceipt - a blockchain-powered inventory and supply chain management solution, and its accompanying cryptocurrency, Shell Token.

## HandReceipt: Modernizing Supply Chain Management

HandReceipt is a blockchain-powered inventory and supply chain management solution that streamlines property tracking and transfers.

### Military Application

HandReceipt digitizes the currently paper-based process of equipment transfers between military personnel. Using scannable QR codes linked to blockchain-secured digital records, we make property accountability simple, reliable, and auditable. Seeks to implement best practices and advantages enabled by private sector systems like SAP, NetSuite, Oracle, and Microsoft Dynamics.

### Commercial Application

For businesses, HandReceipt offers a more affordable and user-friendly alternative to complex enterprise systems like SAP, NetSuite, Oracle, and Microsoft Dynamics. Our solution maintains accurate inventory records while enabling rapid payment processing through USDC stablecoin integrationâ€”allowing for immediate settlement when goods are received and verified.

#### Integration Features
- Commercial users can integrate with existing systems rather than requiring entirely new hardware or processes, including integrating standard enterprise software APIs (ERP, WMS, inventory management)
- Commercial users can employ existing scanning infrastructure (barcodes, RFID) rather than QR codes
- Commercial users have the ability to create smart contracts outlining payment terms between counterparties in supply chain
  - Use of either traditional wire or HandReceipt's own native coin called "Shells" (SHL)
  - Smart contracts completely customizable (can trigger payments based on receipt of goods, sales levels, inventory levels, etc)

### Key Benefits

- Secure digital property records that can't be altered
- Simple QR-code scanning for transfers and verification
  - User uses mobile app to scan a QR code on property or inventory to initiate a transfer request
  - Counterparty who currently in possession of (or is assigned) that piece of property receives notification of transfer request which they can either accept or decline
- Reduced paperwork and manual processes
- Transparent tracking throughout the supply chain
- Optional fast payment settlement for commercial users

## Shell Token: Powering Supply Chain Finance

Shell is a specialized cryptocurrency designed to revolutionize supply chain finance by solving critical pain points in inventory management, payment processing, and working capital optimization. Built on a custom blockchain architecture, Shell directly integrates with HandReceipt, a comprehensive supply chain management solution, as well as existing enterprise systems to create a seamless bridge between physical inventory movements and financial transactions.

### Core Problem Solved
The global supply chain suffers from significant inefficiencies:

- Suppliers wait 60-90 days for payment after shipping goods
- Limited visibility across multi-tier supply chains
- Manual reconciliation processes prone to errors
- Working capital trapped in the supply chain
- Financing options limited by information asymmetry
